# HUMAN TRIBUNAL ⚖️

> **An intentionally absurd AI courtroom where everyday physical human behavior is put on trial.**

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Useless guys

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aban Faruk - Ahalia School of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Haseeb - Ahalia School of Engineering and Technology
### Project Description
Human Tribunal is an absurd AI-powered courtroom experience that monitors physical human behavior in real-time using in-browser computer vision. When suspicious or unusual physical actions are observed—such as sitting completely motionless, raising a hand without judicial clearance, leaning dramatically, or fleeing the camera frame—the system generates structured evidence and initiates a high-stakes courtroom trial. Powered by Gemini, the AI Judge evaluates the evidence alongside the defendant's defense statement, delivering deadpan, Kerala courtroom-flavored verdicts and harmless, comical punishments.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every single day, millions of human beings perform deeply suspicious physical actions in front of their computers without any legal oversight. 

- Nobody investigates why someone suddenly crouched under their desk for 3 seconds.
- Nobody issues a subpoena when a user sits completely motionless staring into space.
- Nobody questions why someone fled the camera frame without requesting a court recess.
- Nobody holds individuals accountable for raising a hand without prior judicial clearance.

This total lack of judicial accountability in daily human movement is a non-existent crisis that threatens the fabric of domestic order.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Human Tribunal solves this completely unnecessary problem by establishing an automated, real-time AI Courtroom:

1. **Browser-Based Surveillance**: Real-time pose tracking runs 100% locally in the browser via WebAssembly computer vision.
2. **Temporal Behavior Analysis**: Physical actions (stillness, crouching, hand gestures, frame departures) are tracked across time to filter out noise and generate verified courtroom evidence.
3. **Structured Case Generation**: Physical observations are structured into formal exhibits (`EXHIBIT A`, `EXHIBIT B`) without sending raw video frames anywhere.
4. **Gemini AI Judge**: Gemini processes the structured evidence, conducts a formal trial, analyzes defendant testimony, and issues authoritative judicial rulings with deadpan Manglish courtroom flavor.
5. **Absurd Sentences**: Defendants found guilty are assigned custom, harmless sentences (e.g., *"Sentenced to buy the court a chaya"* or *"Stand quietly and reflect on your posture for 30 seconds"*).

### Conceptual Architecture & CV vs Gemini Distinction

It is critical to distinguish between the **Computer Vision layer** and the **Gemini Reasoning layer**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Webcam Feed] --> B[MediaPipe Pose Detection - WASM]
    B --> C[Landmark & Spatial Analysis]
    C --> D[Temporal Behaviour Analysis & Cooldowns]
    D --> E[Structured JSON Evidence Exhibit]
    E --> F[Express REST API / Tribunal Session Store]
    F --> G[Gemini Reasoning & Case Generation]
    G --> H[Interactive Courtroom Trial]
    H --> I[Defendant Defence Statement]
    I --> J[AI Judge Deliberation]
    J --> K[Final Judicial Verdict]
    K --> L[Comical Absurd Sentence]
```

#### 1. Computer Vision Layer (Browser WebAssembly)
- **Role**: Physical observation only.
- **Privacy & Execution**: Runs 100% locally inside the browser memory using MediaPipe Pose Landmarker WebAssembly. **No raw video frames, images, or biometric face data are ever uploaded or transmitted.**
- **Landmark & Temporal Analysis**: Analyzes 33 body keypoints (nose, shoulders, hips, wrists, ears) across time frames (`gestureDetector.ts`).
- **Temporal Tracking & Smoothing**: Requires pose persistence over specific duration thresholds (e.g., 4000ms for `STILLNESS`, 1500ms for `CROUCHING`, 800ms for `HAND_RAISED`) and applies a 3000ms cooldown to eliminate single-frame noise and duplicate triggers.
- **Implemented Physical Behaviors**:
  - `STILLNESS`: Sustained lack of nose/body displacement ($\text{dist} < 0.015$).
  - `RIGHT_HAND_RAISED` / `LEFT_HAND_RAISED` / `BOTH_HANDS_RAISED`: Wrist position elevated above shoulder line.
  - `HAND_ON_HEAD`: Wrist landmark within proximity threshold of ear/nose landmarks.
  - `LEANING`: Horizontal offset between shoulder midpoint and hip midpoint $> 0.15$.
  - `CROUCHING`: Torso height ratio $< 0.18$.
  - `SITTING` / `STANDING`: Vertical hip position tracking in camera viewport.
  - `SITTING_DOWN` / `STANDING_UP` / `CROUCHING_DOWN` / `RISING_FROM_CROUCH`: Posture transition tracking.
  - `MOVEMENT`: Active body coordinate displacement.
  - `LEFT_FRAME` / `RETURNED_TO_FRAME`: Landmark tracking loss and recovery.

#### 2. Gemini Layer (AI Judge & Narrative Engine)
- **Role**: Legal interpretation, case drafting, trial moderation, and verdict generation.
- **Zero-Shot Reasoning**: Gemini does **not** require a custom fine-tuned dataset. It receives clean, structured JSON evidence metadata emitted by the CV layer (e.g., `{ "gesture": "STILLNESS", "durationMs": 4200, "source": "CAMERA" }`).
- **Strict Evidence Grounding**: Gemini is strictly instructed via system prompts never to fabricate physical evidence or claim video access—it must base its reasoning exclusively on the provided camera metadata exhibits and defendant testimony.
- **Judicial Personality**: Acts as the Presiding Magistrate of the Human Tribunal—a dramatic, authoritative Indian/Kerala courtroom magistrate with deadpan dry humor, strict legal gravity, and subtle Manglish expressions (*"Athu kond"*, *"Scene is clear"*, *"Shari"*, *"Enthayalum"*).
